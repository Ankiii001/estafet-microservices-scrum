# Estafet Microservices Scrum Demo Application
The scrum demo application is composed of microservices and provides a example of how microservices implement common application aspects, such as data management, stateful domain objects and reporting in a distributed architecture. It is a useful starting point for a Java engineer who is interesting in understanding how microservices are built.

The application is designed to be deployed within an Openshift cluster and provides a convenient platform for demonstrating aspects such as logging, monitoring, release management and testing for microservices.

## Project Structure
One thing to note is that each microservice has its own git repository. Separate repositories means that each service be released independently.

## Getting started
There are a couple of installation options for the demo application:

* [Deployment to an Openshift](https://github.com/Estafet-LTD/estafet-microservices-scrum/tree/master/setup-openshift-deployment)
* [Setting up development environment](https://github.com/Estafet-LTD/estafet-microservices-scrum/tree/master/setup-development-deployment)

## Architecture
The application consists of 7 microservices + the user interface. These are deployed to openshift as pods. The postgres pod instance contains 6 databases, each "owned" by a microservice. The A-MQ broker processes messages sent to topics.
